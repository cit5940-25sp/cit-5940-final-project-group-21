# Movie Name Game Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Java implementation of the Movie Name Game, inspired by the game hosted at [cinenerdle2.app](https://www.cinenerdle2.app/). Our implementation uses movie data from TMDB to create an interactive game where players connect movies through shared attributes like actors, directors, writers, cinematographers, or composers.

## Game Description
The Movie Name Game is a turn-based game where:
- Players take turns naming movies connected to the previously named movie
- Connections can be shared actors, directors, writers, cinematographers, or composers
- Each movie can only be used once in a game
- Any specific connection can only be used up to three times
- Players have 30 seconds to make their move
- Win conditions are established before the game starts (default is genre-based)

## Technical Features
- Implementation of Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern
- Implementation of [Second Design Pattern Name] design pattern
- Advanced data indexing system for efficient movie lookups
- Real-time autocomplete functionality
- Text-based user interface

## Project Structure
- `/src`: Source code
  - `/model`: Data models and business logic
  - `/view`: User interface components
  - `/controller`: Application control flow
- `/test`: Test cases and testing utilities
- `/docs`: Design documents and diagrams

## Design Decisions
- MVC Architecture: Separates data representation from user interaction
- Data Indexing: Optimized for quick movie title search and relationship lookups
- [Second Design Pattern]: Used for [specific functionality]

## Implementation Plan
1. Data structure design and implementation
2. Core game logic development
3. User interface implementation
4. Testing and refinement
5. Optional feature integration

## Running the Application
